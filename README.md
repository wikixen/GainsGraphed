# GainsGraphed

A workout, calorie, & health tracking app. Built with React Native & hosted
using Expo cloud services.

## Why?

There are dozens of workout & calorie tracking apps and most phones provide a
health by default(At least Apple does). However these apps either paywall basic
features or lack features: Boostcamp is a great workout app but lacks a way to
track improv fitness activity and locks many features behind a paywall.
MyFitnessPal is a great calorie tracking app but also hides most features behind
a paywall as well as lacking robust workout tracking features. Cronometer is a
good alternative but is even worse in terms of exercise trackign features. This
app plans to contains the best aspects of all of these apps behind a one time
purchase.
